A project I am working on to make a small alert device that will go into key fobs. It will support free fall & impact detection to alert the holder
of drops.
This project utilizes the following components:
Microcontroller: ATtiny1614
External memory to hold audio: MX25L1606E
Speaker: SM160908-1
Amplifier: LM4871
Accelerometer: LIS2DH12
